## Lab Work

### Oscilloscope Measurements
Waveforms were captured using the Tektronix MDO3024 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope at 250MS/s. The function generator was configured to drive the circuit under test, with multiple channels monitored simultaneously to observe signal behavior across different circuit nodes.

### Circuit Implementation
Multiple analog circuits were constructed on the Proto-Board PB-503, utilizing the onboard DIP switches, potentiometers, SPDT switches, and debounced pushbuttons for input control. Logic indicators were used to verify digital output states where applicable.

### Multi-IC Breadboard Circuit
A more complex analog circuit was implemented using multiple ICs wired across the breadboard. Color-coded jumper wires were used to organize signal paths, power rails, and ground connections for clarity during testing and debugging.

## Key Takeaways

- Hands-on breadboarding builds intuition for signal flow and circuit behavior that simulation alone cannot provide
- Proper use of bench instruments — triggering, scaling, and cursor measurements on an oscilloscope — is essential for accurate data collection
- Color-coded wiring significantly reduces debugging time on complex multi-IC circuits
- Real-world results don't always match simulation exactly — understanding why is part of the engineering process
